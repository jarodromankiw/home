      <h4>For the Cookies</h4>
       <li>Start by combining the dry ingredients (spelt flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon, and cloves) in a medium-size bowl and sift together.</li>
        <li>In a separate large bowl, stir together the wet ingredients (molasses, maple syrup, coconut sugar, applesauce, and melted coconut oil) until well combined.</li>
        <li>Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the wet and stir together with a spatula until a dough forms. It might look like the dough is dry, but don’t worry, just keep stirring.</li>
        <li>After moist dough has formed, divide it into two separate halves and wrap each one with plastic. Refrigerate until cold and firm, for about one hour or up to 2 days.</li>
        <li>When you are ready to bake the cookies, take the dough out and preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a hard surface with parchment paper and lightly sprinkle it and a rolling pin with flour. Gently roll the dough out on the floured surface to roughly 1/4” thick. If it is too hard to roll, try giving it a minute to warm up some.</li>
        <li>Using cookie cutters, press shapes into the dough and use your hands to pull away any excess pieces. Form the excess pieces into a large ball and continue to roll out and cut shapes until all of the dough is gone.</li>
        <li>Transfer the cookies to two baking sheets lined with parchment paper and bake for 10 minutes. Set aside to cool completely before icing.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the icing by combining all of the ingredients in a small bowl and whisking together until smooth. Spoon it into a plastic bag and cut one corner off or use a pastry bag. Slowly pipe the icing on as desired.</li>
        <li>Store cookies in an airtight container between layers of parchment paper for up to one week.</li>
